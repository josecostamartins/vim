vim
====
My personal vim configuration, i mainly use vim for django and python programming nowadays. Other languages, like PHP, C, etc., might be added in the future, case i need them.

DISCLAIMER: still in it's early ages

### Plugins:
* solarized theme for mac vim
* wombat256mod theme for terminal vim
* airline for status line revamped
* jedi-vim for python autocompletion
* virtualenv for managing virutal environments, also useful for jedi-vim autocompletion
* syntastic for syntax checking
* vim-pony for Django Commands
* vundle for plugin management

Also, i auto-install vundle by using this tip:
